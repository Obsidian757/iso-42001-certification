```
Subject: OMB M-25-21 compliance gap for [Company]?

[Name],

With federal AI compliance deadlines hitting March 11 and May 6, 2026, 
I'm seeing defense contractors scramble to understand OMB M-25-21/M-25-22.

I created a free AI System Inventory tool that takes 15 minutes and shows 
exactly where your compliance gaps are. 

Would you like me to send it over? I can also schedule a 30-min call to 
walk through your results.

I'm the first DoD-cleared consultant with ISO 42001 certification—
happy to share my compliance mapping framework.

Brannon
12th House AI

1. Review inventory results together
2. Identify high-risk systems
3. Introduce compliance mapping: "Here's how ISO 42001 covers all OMB requirements"
4. Position urgency: "March 11 deadline for LLM contracts, May 6 for policy updates"
5. Recommend next steps: Gap analysis ($7.5K-$25K) or full implementation ($25K-$75K)
