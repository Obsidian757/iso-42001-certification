# Unified AI Governance + Cybersecurity Compliance Offering

**ISO 42001:2023 + CMMC 2.0 Combined Implementation**

---

## Executive Overview

### The Problem

Defense contractors using AI face **dual compliance pressure**:

| Requirement | Deadline | Consequence |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **CMMC 2.0** | Oct 2026 | Cannot bid on DoD contracts with CUI |
| **OMB M-25-21** | May 2026 | AI governance for federal agencies |
| **ISO 42001** | Emerging | International AI management standard |

**Reality:** AI systems that process CUI need **both** cybersecurity (CMMC) AND AI governance (ISO 42001/NIST AI RMF). Most consultants address one or the other. You need both.

### The Solution

**12th House AI offers the industry's first integrated implementation:**

> **"One governance framework. Two compliance requirements satisfied. Delivered in 90 days through AI-assisted methodology."**

Our AI-native delivery approach accelerates documentation, assessment, and implementation—compressing traditional 6-9 month timelines into 4-6 months without sacrificing quality or rigor.

## Why Combine ISO 42001 + CMMC?

### Overlapping Requirements

| ISO 42001 Control | CMMC Domain | Synergy |
|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| AI Risk Assessment (6.1) | Risk Management (RM) | Unified risk register |
| Data Governance (8.3) | Media Protection (MP) | Single data handling framework |
| Third-Party AI (8.6) | Supply Chain | Vendor assessment for AI + security |
| Incident Response (8.13) | Incident Response (IR) | AI-aware security incidents |
| Access Control (implicit) | Access Control (AC) | AI system access policies |
| Audit & Logging | Audit (AU) | AI decision audit trails |

### Cost Savings Through Integration

| Approach | Time | Cost | Complexity |
|----------|------|------|------------|
| CMMC Only | 4-6 months | $25K-$50K | Moderate |
| ISO 42001 Only | 3-4 months | $15K-$75K | Moderate |
| **Combined (Our Approach)** | **4-6 months** | **$35K-$85K** | **Simplified** |

**You save:**
- 2-3 months vs. sequential implementations
- $15K-$40K vs. separate consulting engagements
- One audit preparation instead of two

## AI-Native Delivery Methodology

### The 12th House AI Advantage

While traditional consultants deliver compliance frameworks through manual, sequential processes, **12th House AI leverages an AI-assisted methodology** that accelerates implementation without sacrificing quality.

**Traditional Approach:**
- Manual policy drafting: 40-60 hours per document set
- Sequential client delivery: One engagement at a time
- Spreadsheet-based tracking: Error-prone and slow
- Timeline: 6-9 months typical

**Our AI-Augmented Approach:**
- **Accelerated documentation:** AI-assisted policy development reduces delivery time by 70%
- **Parallel processing:** Multiple workstreams advance simultaneously
- **Intelligent gap analysis:** Automated assessment against CMMC + ISO 42001 requirements
- **Consistent quality:** Standardized templates with client-specific customization
- **Timeline: 90-day implementation cycles**

**The Result:** Enterprise-grade compliance documentation delivered in weeks, not months—at a fraction of traditional consulting costs.

> *"Our proprietary AI-assisted framework maintains the rigor required for certification while dramatically compressing implementation timelines."*

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do we really need both CMMC and ISO 42001?**

A: If you handle CUI AND use AI, yes. CMMC protects the infrastructure; ISO 42001 governs the AI. AI systems processing CUI need both.

**Q: Can we do CMMC first, then ISO 42001 later?**

A: Yes, but it costs more and takes longer. Integration saves $15K-$40K and 2-3 months.

**Q: What if we only need CMMC Level 1?**

A: Level 1 is for basic safeguarding (no CUI). If you don't handle CUI, you may not need CMMC at all. We can adjust the scope.

**Q: How does this relate to NIST AI RMF?**

A: ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF are aligned. Our ISO 42001 implementation satisfies NIST AI RMF requirements.

**Q: What if we fail the assessment?**

A: Tier 3 includes POA&M support and remediation. Most clients achieve certification on first attempt with proper preparation.

**Q: Can you work with our existing IT/security provider?**

A: Absolutely. We can integrate with your MSP, MSSP, or internal IT team.
