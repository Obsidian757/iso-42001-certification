## Exam Strategy

| Tip | Why It Matters |
|-----|----------------|
| **80% pass rate** | You can miss 20%—don't stress over edge cases |
| **2 attempts/day, 6 max** | If you fail, review notes, try again same day |
| **Focus on roles** | CMMC ecosystem roles are heavily tested |
| **Know the levels** | Level 1 vs 2 vs 3 distinctions appear often |

## Module-by-Module Key Concepts

### Module 1: CMMC Overview

**Must-Know:**
- CMMC = Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification
- Purpose: Protect CUI (Controlled Unclassified Information) in defense supply chain
- Three maturity levels: 1 (Basic), 2 (Intermediate), 3 (Expert)
- Based on NIST SP 800-171 (Level 2) + additional requirements (Level 3)

**Quiz Focus:**
- What does CMMC protect? **CUI**
- What standard is Level 2 based on? **NIST SP 800-171**
- How many levels? **3**

---

### Module 2: CMMC Ecosystem Roles

**CRITICAL—HEAVILY TESTED**

| Role | What They Do | Key Limitation |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **RP** (Registered Practitioner) | Consulting, gap assessments, prep | Cannot conduct official assessments |
| **RPO** (Registered Practitioner Organization) | Company employing RPs | Same limits as RP |
| **C3PAO** (Certified 3rd Party Assessment Org) | Official CMMC assessments | Cannot consult for same client they assess |
| **CCA** (Certified CMMC Assessor) | Lead assessor for C3PAO | Must be CCP first |
| **CCP** (Certified CMMC Professional) | Assessment team member | Cannot lead assessments alone |
| **CAGE Code** | Required for CMMC registration | Identifier in SAM.gov |

**Key Rule:**
- C3PAOs **cannot** provide consulting to clients they assess (independence requirement)
- RPs **cannot** sign off on assessments or issue certificates

### Module 3: CMMC Model Structure

**Domains (14 total)** — Know the acronym:

| Domain | Focus Area | Level 2 Controls |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| **AC** | Access Control | ~20 |
| **AM** | Asset Management | ~5 |
| **AU** | Audit & Accountability | ~10 |
| **CM** | Configuration Management | ~15 |
| **IA** | Identification & Authentication | ~10 |
| **IR** | Incident Response | ~10 |
| **MA** | Maintenance | ~5 |
| **MP** | Media Protection | ~10 |
| **PE** | Physical Protection | ~10 |
| **PS** | Personnel Security | ~5 |
| **RE** | Recovery | ~5 |
| **RM** | Risk Management | ~10 |
| **SA** | Security Assessment | ~10 |
| **SC** | System & Communications Protection | ~20 |
| **SI** | System & Information Integrity | ~15 |

**Total Level 2 Controls: 110** (from NIST 800-171 Rev 2)

**Maturity Levels:**
- **Level 1:** 17 practices (basic safeguarding)
- **Level 2:** 110 practices (NIST 800-171) — MOST COMMON
- **Level 3:** 110 + 24 additional (NIST 800-172 subset)

---

### Module 4: Assessment Process

**Three Assessment Types:**

1. **Joint Surveillance Voluntary Assessment (JSVA)**
   - Government-conducted
   - Not certification, but shows readiness
   - Results go to SPRS

2. **Certification Assessment (C3PAO)**
   - Official CMMC certification
   - Required for contracts requiring CMMC
   - Valid 3 years

3. **Government-Led Assessment**
   - For high-risk/high-complexity environments
   - DCMA or DIBCAC conducts

**Assessment Phases:**
1. Planning & preparation
2. Evidence collection
3. Control validation
4. Report generation
5. Quality assurance (C3PAO internal)
6. Submission to CyberAB

---

### Module 5: Scoring Methodology

**Scoring System:**

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Met** | Control fully implemented |
| **Not Met** | Control not implemented |
| **Not Applicable** | Control doesn't apply (must justify) |

**Passing Scores:**
- **Level 1:** All objectives met (100%)
- **Level 2:** 80% of practices met minimum
- **Level 3:** 80% + all critical objectives

**Key Concept:** POA&M (Plan of Action & Milestones)
- Allows conditional certification with open items
- Must be closed within 180 days (Level 2) or 90 days (Level 3)

---

### Module 6: SPRS (Supplier Performance Risk System)

**Key Points:**
- Self-assessment scores posted here
- Primes check sub scores before awarding
- Score ranges 0-110 (for NIST 800-171) or -203 to 110 (for CMMC)
- Lower score = higher risk

**Scoring Nuances:**
- Implementing control = full points
- Partially implemented = partial points
- Planned implementation = negative points

---

### Module 7: CUI & DFARS

**Must-Know:**
- **CUI** = Controlled Unclassified Information
- **DFARS 252.204-7012** = Cybersecurity clause requiring NIST 800-171
- **DFARS 252.204-7021** = CMMC implementation clause

**Who must comply?**
- Anyone handling CUI on DoD contracts
- Primes must flow down to subs handling CUI

---

### Module 8-9: Assessment Execution

**RP Perspective:**
- RPs help clients prepare evidence
- RPs can conduct "mock assessments"
- RPs cannot sign official assessment reports

**Evidence Types:**
- Policies & procedures (documented)
- System configurations (technical)
- Interview responses (personnel)
- Physical inspection (facilities)

---

### Module 10: Appeals & Disputes

**Process:**
1. Client receives adverse finding
2. Appeals to C3PAO first
3. If unresolved, appeals to CyberAB
4. Final authority: CyberAB

**RP Role:** Help clients prepare appeal documentation

---

### Module 11: Code of Professional Conduct

**Key Requirements:**
- Protect confidential client information
- Avoid conflicts of interest
- Maintain competency
- Report violations to CyberAB
- No false statements or misrepresentation

**Consequences:**
- Warning → Suspension → Revocation
- May be barred from CMMC ecosystem

---

### Module 12: Continuous Monitoring

**After Certification:**
- Annual affirmation required
- Interim assessments if major changes
- Incident reporting to CyberAB
- Re-certification every 3 years
