# Cold Outreach Email Templates

**For Federal AI Compliance Client Acquisition**

---

## TEMPLATE 1: Initial Outreach - Defense Contractors

**Subject Line Options:**
- AI compliance gaps I noticed at [Company]
- Quick question about your AI governance
- ISO 42001 + CMMC question for [Company]
- OMB M-25-21 deadline approaching

---

**Email:**

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] works in [defense/federal space]. Quick question:

How are you handling AI governance for federal contracts?

With OMB M-25-21/M-25-22 deadlines hitting in 2026 and CMMC now mandatory, I'm seeing a lot of defense subs scrambling to figure out AI compliance.

I built a simple AI inventory tool that takes 15 minutes and reveals:
- What AI systems you're actually using (including Shadow AI)
- Which systems need compliance controls
- Your biggest risk areas

Would it be useful if I sent it over?

I'm also happy to jump on a quick call if you want to talk through the federal AI landscape. No pitch - just context on what's coming.

Best,
Brannon

P.S. - I'm one of the first consultants with ISO 42001 + NIST AI RMF expertise + active DoD clearance. If that combination is relevant to your work, let me know.

## TEMPLATE 2: Initial Outreach - SMB Tech Companies

**Subject Lines:**
- Is your AI usage compliant?
- Quick AI governance question
- AI compliance before it becomes a problem

---

**Email:**

Hi [Name],

I help companies get ahead of AI compliance before it becomes a problem.

Here's what I'm seeing:

Most organizations are using AI (ChatGPT, Copilot, AI features in software) but have zero governance around it.

That works until:
- A client asks about your AI policies
- Regulated data flows to an AI vendor  
- You want federal contracts and need compliance credentials

The fix isn't complicated - it just requires doing it before you need it.

I created a free AI System Inventory template that helps you:
1. Find all AI usage across your organization
2. Identify compliance risks
3. Prioritize what to address first

Takes 15 minutes. Want me to send it?

Best,
Brannon

## TEMPLATE 3: Follow-Up (3 days after no response)

**Subject:** Re: [Original subject]

---

**Email:**

Hi [Name],

Quick follow-up on my earlier note about AI compliance.

Totally understand if this isn't a priority right now. But in case it's helpful:

I'm publishing a weekly LinkedIn series on federal AI compliance - covering OMB memos, ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF, and how they all fit together.

If you'd like to follow along: linkedin.com/in/brannonsolomon

No pressure either way. Just thought it might be useful context as AI governance requirements accelerate.

Best,
Brannon

## TEMPLATE 4: Warm Outreach - Referral/Connection

**Subject:** [Mutual connection] suggested we connect

Hi [Name],

[Mutual connection] mentioned you're dealing with [AI compliance / federal contracting / CMMC] challenges at [Company].

That's exactly what I help with.

Quick background: I'm building an AI compliance consultancy focused on defense contractors. 20+ years in Navy/DoD systems, active Secret clearance, currently pursuing ISO 42001 certification.

I'd love to learn more about what [Company] is working on and see if there's a way I can help.

Open to a 15-minute call this week?

## TEMPLATE 5: Post-Event/Webinar Follow-Up

**Subject:** Great meeting you at [Event]

---

**Email:**

Hi [Name],

Good connecting at [Event] yesterday. I appreciated your questions about [topic discussed].

As promised, here are a couple resources you mentioned would be helpful:

1. **AI System Inventory template** - 15-minute assessment of your AI usage
2. **Federal AI Compliance Mapping** - How ISO 42001 maps to OMB/NIST requirements

[Links or attachments]

If you want to dig deeper on any of this, I'm happy to jump on a call. I've got availability [next week].

Best,

## TEMPLATE 6: Trigger Event - RFP/Award Announcement

**Subject:** Congrats on [Contract Award] - AI compliance thought

---

**Email:**

Hi [Name],

Saw the announcement about [Company]'s [contract award]. Congrats - that's a significant win.

Quick thought: If that contract involves any AI systems (even basic tools like ChatGPT or Copilot), there are some new compliance requirements worth considering.

OMB M-25-21 and M-25-22 are creating AI governance requirements for federal work, and CMMC 2.0 has specific implications for AI cybersecurity.

I work with defense contractors navigating exactly this. If it would help to talk through the landscape, I'm happy to jump on a call.

Either way, congrats again on the win.

Best,
Brannon

I'm curious - how is [Company] approaching AI governance as the federal requirements ramp up? Seeing a lot of questions in the defense space right now.

If it's ever useful to talk through the landscape (OMB memos, ISO 42001, CMMC implications for AI), I'm happy to jump on a call. No pitch - just context sharing.

Hi [Name],

I reached out a while back about AI governance and figured you were busy. Totally get it.

No pressure - just wanted you to know the offer stands.
