## POST 1: The Problem - AI Compliance Chaos

**Best day to post:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 8-9am EST

---

**[READY TO POST]**

🚨 **Federal AI compliance just got complicated.**

In the last 12 months, federal contractors have been hit with:

- OMB M-25-21 (AI governance requirements)
- OMB M-25-22 (AI procurement rules)
- EO 14110 (AI safety and security)
- EO 14179 (innovation acceleration)
- CMMC 2.0 (mandatory Nov 2025)
- And now... ISO 42001:2023

If you're a defense contractor using AI, you're probably asking:
"What do I actually need to comply with?"

Here's the reality:
**These frameworks overlap, but not completely.**

NIST AI RMF gives you the methodology.
ISO 42001 gives you the management system.
CMMC gives you the cybersecurity foundation.
OMB memos give you the federal-specific requirements.

Most contractors are trying to manage 4-5 different compliance frameworks with no integration strategy.

**The solution?** A unified approach that maps all requirements to a single governance framework.

That's exactly what we built at 12th House AI.

In the next few weeks, I'll be sharing:
→ How ISO 42001 maps to OMB M-25-21 and M-25-22
→ Why NIST AI RMF + ISO 42001 is the winning combination
→ What defense contractors need to prioritize NOW
→ The certification path I'm taking (in real-time)

If you're managing AI compliance for a federal contractor, follow along. This stuff matters more every month.

## POST 2: ISO 42001 Explained Simply

**Best day to post:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 8-9am EST

---

**[READY TO POST]**

📋 **What is ISO 42001:2023 and why should defense contractors care?**

I get this question a lot. Here's the plain English version:

**ISO 42001 is the first international standard for AI management systems.**

Think of it like ISO 27001 was for cybersecurity:
- A framework for managing AI responsibly
- A certifiable standard (auditors check your work)
- A competitive differentiator for contracts

**What it covers:**
✓ AI governance structure
✓ Risk management for AI
✓ AI lifecycle management
✓ Third-party AI oversight (yes, your Claude/GPT usage)
✓ Transparency and accountability
✓ Data quality for AI
✓ Human oversight requirements

**Why defense contractors need this:**
1. OMB M-25-21 requires "high-impact AI" governance - ISO 42001 satisfies this
2. EO 14110 requires contractor accountability - ISO 42001 provides the framework
3. Federal RFPs increasingly reference AI compliance - certification sets you apart
4. Primes are starting to flow down AI requirements - subs need to be ready

**The timing angle:**
- ISO 42001 was published December 2023
- We're still early - most competitors don't have this
- First movers get premium positioning

I'm currently pursuing ISO 42001 certification for 12th House AI. 

Will share the entire journey - gaps, costs, timeline, lessons learned.

## POST 3: The Credential Stack Nobody Has

**Best day to post:** Thursday, 8-9am EST

---

**[READY TO POST]**

🎯 **The credential stack that defense contractors actually need:**

After 20+ years in DoD systems, I've learned something:

**Credentials only matter if they solve real problems.**

Here's what federal AI work actually requires:

**Security Clearance** ← You can't discuss CUI without it
**NIST AI RMF expertise** ← Federal agencies mandate this
**ISO 42001 certification** ← International AI governance credibility
**CMMC knowledge** ← Required for ALL defense contractors now

Most consultants have 1-2 of these.
Almost nobody has all 4.

I'm building this stack because I saw the gap firsthand:

- AI consultants who can't work with classified info
- Security consultants who don't understand AI risks
- Compliance experts who've never touched NIST AI RMF
- DoD veterans who aren't current on AI governance

The market is fragmented. Clients are frustrated.

**The solution:** Consultants who speak all the languages.

Defense + AI + Compliance + Clearance

If you're a defense sub in Hampton Roads (or anywhere) trying to figure out AI compliance, this is the stack you need supporting you.

Currently finalizing ISO 42001 and CMMC credentials to complete the picture.

What credential gaps are you seeing in the federal AI space?

## POST 4: The Hidden AI Problem

**Best day to post:** Tuesday, 8-9am EST

---

**[READY TO POST]**

🔍 **The AI compliance problem nobody talks about:**

It's not the AI systems you're building.

It's the AI systems you're already using.

I recently helped a defense contractor inventory their AI usage.

What we found:
- 12 employees using ChatGPT for work tasks
- 3 using GitHub Copilot with proprietary code
- Marketing using Jasper AI for proposal content
- Finance using AI features in their accounting software
- Nobody knew any of this was happening

**Zero governance. Zero oversight. Zero compliance.**

This is "Shadow AI" - and it's everywhere.

Why it matters for federal contractors:
1. **Data leakage** - CUI could be going to AI vendors
2. **Compliance gaps** - OMB M-25-21 requires AI oversight
3. **Contract risk** - One leak could end your clearance
4. **Audit exposure** - "We didn't know" isn't a defense

**The fix:**
1. Inventory ALL AI usage (including consumer tools)
2. Classify data flowing to each AI
3. Implement governance controls
4. Train your people

We built a free AI System Inventory template for exactly this.

Comment "INVENTORY" and I'll send it to you.

## POST 5: The Journey Post (Authenticity)

**Best day to post:** Wednesday or Friday, 8-9am EST

---

**[READY TO POST]**

📈 **Why I'm pursuing ISO 42001 certification (and documenting the whole thing):**

Full transparency:

I'm building 12th House AI to be the go-to federal AI compliance consultancy.

Not because it's easy. Because it's necessary.

Here's what I see:
- Federal AI mandates accelerating (OMB, EOs, CMMC)
- Defense contractors scrambling to understand requirements
- AI consultants who don't understand federal compliance
- Compliance consultants who don't understand AI

There's a gap. I'm filling it.

**My approach:**
1. Get certified myself (ISO 42001 + CMMC RP)
2. Document the entire process publicly
3. Build tools that help others (templates, guides, frameworks)
4. Serve defense contractors who need real expertise

**Why document publicly?**
- Accountability (you'll hold me to it)
- Provide value (you can learn from my journey)
- Build trust (no gatekeeping, just sharing)

**Current status:**
- ISO 42001 documentation: 90% complete
- Target certification: February 28, 2026
- CMMC RP: Starting next week

Will share updates along the way - wins, setbacks, lessons.

Follow along if you're interested in federal AI compliance.

Or if you just want to see if I actually pull this off 💪

## POST 6: The Value Proposition

**Best day to post:** Tuesday, 8-9am EST

---

**[READY TO POST]**

💰 **What ISO 42001 certification is actually worth:**

Let's talk numbers.

**Market rate for AI compliance contractors:** $100-150/hour

**Market rate for ISO 42001-certified AI compliance experts:** $200-300/hour

**The difference:** $100K+ annually on the same utilization

But here's the real value:

**Contract access:**
- RFPs increasingly require AI governance credentials
- Primes want certified subs
- Security-conscious clients pay premium for verified expertise

**Risk reduction:**
- ISO certification = third-party verified controls
- Clients know you're not just saying you're compliant
- Reduces their vendor risk

**Market positioning:**
- Early adopter advantage (standard is <3 years old)
- Few competitors have this yet
- First-mover in defense sector = premium positioning

**The math for a consultancy:**
- Investment: ~$15K (certification + time)
- Premium per engagement: $5K-$10K minimum
- Payback: 2-3 engagements

**The math for a contractor:**
- Investment: ~$15K
- Contract won because of certification: $100K+
- Payback: Immediate

Is ISO 42001 worth it? 

For federal contractors using AI, it's becoming table stakes.

For consultants, it's a career differentiator.

What's your take - is AI certification hype or substance?
