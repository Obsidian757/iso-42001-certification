# ISO 42001 Federal AI Compliance Service

## Transform AI Chaos Into Certified Compliance

---

### THE PROBLEM

**Federal AI mandates are accelerating faster than contractors can adapt:**

- OMB M-25-21 requires AI governance by May 2026
- OMB M-25-22 mandates AI procurement compliance  
- EO 14110 holds contractors liable for third-party AI
- CMMC 2.0 requires cybersecurity for all AI systems
- ISO 42001 is becoming the international standard

**Most contractors are managing 4-5 overlapping frameworks with no integration strategy.**

---

### THE SOLUTION

**12th House AI provides unified AI compliance that satisfies all federal requirements.**

We map ISO 42001 to:
- ✓ NIST AI Risk Management Framework
- ✓ OMB M-25-21 and M-25-22
- ✓ Executive Order requirements
- ✓ CMMC cybersecurity standards
- ✓ HIPAA/FERPA data protections (as applicable)

**One governance framework. Multiple compliance requirements satisfied.**

A: Typically 4-9 months. With our accelerated approach and AI assistance, some achieve certification in 90 days.
