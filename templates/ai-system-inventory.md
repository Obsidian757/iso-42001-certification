# AI System Inventory Template

**For organizations exploring AI but not yet ready for full compliance programs**

---

## Purpose

This simple inventory helps you:
- Know what AI you're actually using (including "shadow AI")
- Understand compliance requirements for each AI system
- Prioritize which AI systems need governance first
- Begin your journey toward ISO 42001 / NIST AI RMF / OMB compliance

**Time to complete:** 15-30 minutes  
**Review frequency:** Quarterly or when adding new AI systems

## Instructions

1. List every AI system, tool, or service your organization uses
2. Include both formal systems (purchased, deployed) and informal tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)
3. Answer the questions for each AI system
4. Use the risk scoring to prioritize governance efforts

## Recommended Next Steps

Based on your inventory, here's what to prioritize:

### Immediate Actions (This Month)

**For High-Priority Systems:**
1. Review vendor contracts - upgrade from consumer to enterprise licenses if needed
2. Implement access controls - who can use these AI systems?
3. Establish data handling rules - what data is allowed/forbidden?
4. Set up basic monitoring - log AI usage and watch for incidents

**For Shadow IT:**
1. Identify unauthorized AI use and assess risks
2. Either approve with governance or block usage
3. Communicate AI acceptable use policy to all staff

### Short-Term (Next 90 Days)

**If you have federal contracts or regulated data:**
1. Conduct AI compliance assessment (OMB M-25-21/M-25-22, NIST AI RMF, HIPAA, etc.)
2. Document AI governance policies
3. Implement required controls for high-risk AI systems
4. Train staff on AI compliance requirements

**If you're considering AI expansion:**
1. Before adding new AI systems, establish AI governance framework
2. Create AI impact assessment process (use template in ISO 42001 toolkit)
3. Define AI objectives aligned with business goals

### Long-Term (6-12 Months)

**For mature AI governance:**
1. Pursue ISO 42001:2023 certification for competitive advantage
2. Build AI Center of Excellence or assign AI governance owner
3. Implement continuous AI monitoring and performance tracking
4. Establish AI ethics and responsible AI principles

## Example: Completed Inventory Entry

**AI System Name:** ChatGPT (Staff Use)

**Category:** ☑ Productivity Tool

**Vendor/Provider:** OpenAI

**Who Uses It?** ☑ Sales/Marketing ☑ Operations ☑ All Staff

**What does it do?** Staff use ChatGPT to draft emails, summarize documents, brainstorm ideas, and research topics

**Data Access:** ☑ Company internal documents ☑ Customer data (PII) ← **RISK!**

**Status:** ☑ Shadow IT (unauthorized use) ← **RISK!**

**Contract:** ☑ Free/Consumer version ← **RISK!**

**Compliance Needs:** ☑ OMB M-25-21 (we're a federal contractor) ☑ ISO 42001 (pursuing certification)

**Risk Score:** Impact (2) + Data (3) + Users (3) = **8 / 9** → **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Priority:** ☑ High

**Action Needed:**
1. Purchase ChatGPT Team or Enterprise with Business Associate Agreement
2. Establish data handling policy (no CUI, no customer PII in prompts)
3. Train staff on acceptable use
4. Set up audit logging
5. Document in AI governance framework
