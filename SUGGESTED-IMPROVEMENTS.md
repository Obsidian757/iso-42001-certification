# Suggested Improvements for ISO 42001 Package

**Reviewed by:** Claude Code (Opus 4.5)
**Date:** January 31, 2026
**Status:** Pending Kimi review before implementation

---

## Summary

Five improvements identified during project review. Each addresses audit readiness or documentation hygiene issues.

---

## 1. Fix MASTER_TRACKING.md Inconsistency

**Location:** `client-management/MASTER_TRACKING.md`

**Issue:** Quick Stats show "0 clients" but Active Clients table lists "Acme Defense Systems at 65%"

**Why it matters:** Auditors reviewing documentation will notice this discrepancy. It undermines confidence in record-keeping. Either the stats are wrong or the entry is example data that wasn't labeled as such.

**Recommended fix:**
- Change the Acme row to a commented-out example
- Or update stats to reflect it as a real client
- Add "Last Updated" with actual date instead of placeholder text

---

## 2. Create AUDIT-READINESS-CHECKLIST.md

**Location:** `evidence/AUDIT-READINESS-CHECKLIST.md` (new file)

**Issue:** 15+ documents, templates, and evidence files scattered across folders. No single view of audit readiness.

**Why it matters:** ISO audits are pass/fail on specific control requirements. A checklist consolidates everything into one pre-flight check. Auditors also like seeing that you self-assessed before they arrived.

**Recommended content:**
- Stage 1 readiness items (document review)
- Stage 2 readiness items (implementation evidence)
- Signature/authorization status
- Pre-audit final review section

---

## 3. Create CHANGELOG.md

**Location:** `CHANGELOG.md` (new file at root)

**Issue:** No version history for the documentation package.

**Why it matters:** ISO 42001 requires document control (versioning, review dates, change tracking). A changelog demonstrates you're managing your AIMS documentation as a controlled system, not just a folder of files. Auditors check for this per Clause 7.5.

**Recommended content:**
- Version 1.0.0 entry for initial package (Jan 31, 2026)
- List of all documents created
- Unreleased section for pending changes

---

## 4. Commit Untracked Evidence File

**Location:** `evidence/PRE-SIGNATURE-VERIFICATION.md`

**Issue:** File exists but isn't tracked in git.

**Why it matters:** If you lose this file or switch machines, you lose evidence. Git is your audit trail backup. All evidence should be version controlled.

**Recommended fix:**
```bash
git add evidence/PRE-SIGNATURE-VERIFICATION.md
git commit -m "Add pre-signature verification evidence"
```

---

## 5. Add First Management Review Placeholder

**Location:** `evidence/governance-reviews/` (empty folder)

**Issue:** No management review documentation exists.

**Why it matters:** ISO 42001 Clause 9.3 requires management review. You need at least one documented review before Stage 2 audit to prove the AIMS is operational, not just documented. The template exists at `templates/management-review-template.md` but no completed review is in evidence.

**Recommended fix:**
- Create `evidence/governance-reviews/2026-Q1-management-review.md`
- Use the template to conduct and document first review
- This should happen BEFORE Stage 1 audit ideally

## Decision Required

Kimi: Review these suggestions and decide which to implement. Reply with:
- "Implement all" - Apply all five changes
- "Implement #X, #Y" - Apply specific changes
- "Discuss #X" - Need more context on specific item
- "Skip" - Proceed without changes
