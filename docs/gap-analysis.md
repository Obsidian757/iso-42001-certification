# 12th House AI - ISO 42001 Gap Analysis

**Assessment Date:** January 31, 2026  
**Assessor:** Brannon Solomon (Self-Assessment)  
**Target:** ISO 42001:2023 certification by February 28, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Readiness: 65%**

12th House AI has a strong foundation for ISO 42001 certification due to existing NIST AI RMF expertise, operational AI systems (VoiceGuard, RMF Navigator), and deep federal compliance knowledge. Primary gaps are in formal documentation, metrics tracking, and audit processes.

**Critical Path Items (Must Complete):**
1. Document AI lifecycle processes for VoiceGuard/RMF Navigator
2. Create and populate AI risk register
3. Establish metrics tracking system
4. Conduct initial internal audit
5. Complete Annex A controls assessment

**Estimated Effort to Close Gaps:** 40-50 hours over 4 weeks (achievable with AI assistance)

## Risk Assessment: Can We Hit Feb 28?

**Feasibility Analysis:**

| Factor | Assessment | Risk Level |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Documentation Volume** | 55 hours work, AI can draft 70% of it | 🟡 Medium |
| **Your Domain Expertise** | Extremely strong - know the content, just need to write it down | ✅ Low |
| **Certification Body Availability** | Unknown - need quotes ASAP | 🔴 High |
| **Audit Timeline** | Stage 1 + Stage 2 typically 2-4 weeks apart | 🔴 High |
| **Scope Complexity** | Consulting services + VoiceGuard = moderate scope | 🟡 Medium |

**Overall Risk: High**

**Recommendation:**
- **Plan A:** Contact certification bodies Monday (Feb 3) and request expedited timeline. If they can schedule Stage 1 by Feb 10 and Stage 2 by Feb 24, Feb 28 is achievable.
- **Plan B:** If certification bodies can't accommodate, target "ISO 42001 implementation in progress" status by Feb 28, full certification by March 31.
- **Plan C:** Pursue individual ISO 42001 Lead Implementer certification (PECB 5-day course) while completing organizational cert. Still valuable credential.

## Competitive Advantage Analysis

**What You Have That Others Don't:**

1. **Deep Federal Knowledge** - Most ISO consultants don't understand OMB memos or DFARS
2. **Operational AI Systems** - VoiceGuard gives you real implementation evidence
3. **NIST + ISO Hybrid** - Can offer integrated compliance, not just one framework
4. **DoD Clearance** - Work on classified AI (competitive moat for defense)
5. **Rapid Implementation Culture** - 90-day cycles vs. 9-month enterprise timelines

**Market Positioning Once Certified:**

> "The only ISO 42001-certified AI consultant with active DoD clearance and NIST AI RMF expertise, exclusively serving defense contractors in the Hampton Roads region."

**This gap analysis shows you're not starting from scratch - you're translating existing expertise into ISO format.**

---

## Next Steps (Monday, Feb 3)

1. **Contact Certification Bodies** - Get expedited quotes from:
   - BSI: https://www.bsigroup.com/
   - DNV: https://www.dnv.com/
   - SGS: https://www.sgs.com/
   - Request: "ISO 42001 certification for solo AI consultant, target completion Feb 28, 2026. Can you accommodate?"

2. **Create Risk Register** - Start populating with VoiceGuard/client engagement risks

3. **Set Up Documentation Repository** - Centralize all AIMS documents

4. **Review Policy** - Read the AI policy created, edit as needed, prepare to sign

**You're 65% there. The remaining 35% is execution, not invention.**
