# 12th House AI - AI Governance Statement

**Our Commitment to Responsible AI**

---

## Who We Are

12th House AI is a federal AI compliance consultancy helping defense and government contractors build, deploy, and govern AI systems that meet the highest standards of security, ethics, and regulatory compliance.

---

## Our AI Governance Principles

### 1. Human-Centric AI
We design AI systems that augment human decision-making, not replace human judgment. Every AI solution we deliver includes meaningful human oversight.

### 2. Transparency & Explainability
We document how our AI systems work, what data they use, and what limitations they have. Clients receive clear explanations of AI-driven outputs.

### 3. Security First
As a company founded by a Navy veteran with active DoD Secret clearance, we apply defense-grade security to all AI implementations. Zero trust architecture is our default.

### 4. Compliance by Design
We build regulatory requirements (NIST AI RMF, OMB memos, ISO 42001) into every AI system from day one—not as an afterthought.

### 5. Continuous Accountability
Every AI system has a named owner. Every decision is traceable. Every incident is investigated and learned from.
