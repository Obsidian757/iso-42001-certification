# Federal AI Compliance Framework
## ISO 42001:2023 ↔ OMB M-25-21/M-25-22 ↔ Executive Orders

**Mapping Guide for Federal Contractors**

---

## Executive Summary

This document maps **ISO/IEC 42001:2023** (AI Management Systems) to federal AI compliance requirements, specifically:
- **OMB M-25-21:** Accelerating Federal Use of AI
- **OMB M-25-22:** Driving Efficient Acquisition of AI
- **Executive Order 14110:** Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI (Biden Administration - baseline framework)
- **Executive Order 14179:** Removing Barriers to American Leadership in AI (Trump Administration)

**Why This Matters:**
Federal contractors face overlapping AI compliance requirements. ISO 42001 provides a unified governance framework that addresses all federal mandates. This mapping shows exactly how ISO 42001 certification satisfies OMB and EO requirements.

**Key Insight:**
ISO 42001 is **more comprehensive** than any single federal requirement. Achieving ISO 42001 certification means you exceed minimum federal standards.

## Why ISO 42001 + NIST AI RMF is the Winning Combination

**For federal contractors, neither ISO 42001 nor NIST AI RMF alone is sufficient. Use both:**

### NIST AI RMF (Free, U.S.-Focused)
- **Govern, Map, Measure, Manage** functions
- Detailed risk assessment playbooks
- Federal agency alignment
- Free to download and implement
- Not certifiable (self-attestation)

### ISO 42001:2023 (Paid, Internationally Recognized)
- Formal management system structure
- Certifiable by third-party auditors
- External credibility and validation
- Enterprise governance framework
- Global applicability

### The Hybrid Approach

**ISO 42001 for governance structure** ← *What* to do  
**NIST AI RMF for risk assessment** ← *How* to do it

**Example Integration:**
- ISO Clause 6.1 (Risk Assessment) → Use NIST AI RMF methodology to execute it
- ISO Clause 8.2 (AI Impact Assessment) → Incorporate NIST's "Map" function
- ISO Clause 9.1 (Monitoring) → Use NIST's "Measure" function

**Why this works:**
- Satisfies OMB M-25-21 requirement for NIST alignment
- Provides certifiable compliance via ISO 42001
- Demonstrates both federal and international standards adherence
- **Competitive advantage:** Few consultants offer integrated ISO + NIST approach

---

## Timeline for Federal Contractors

### Immediate Deadlines

**March 11, 2026:** LLM procurement contracts must include "Unbiased AI Principles" (OMB M-25-22)
- **Action:** Review all contracts for AI/LLM components, update terms

**May 6, 2026:** Federal agencies must update AI policies (OMB M-25-21 & M-25-22)
- **Contractor Impact:** Expect new flow-down requirements from primes starting May 2026

### Ongoing Requirements

**Every 2 years until 2036:** Federal agencies submit compliance plans (OMB M-25-21, Sec. 6)
- **Contractor Impact:** Compliance verification may be required in contract renewals

**Continuous:** NIST AI RMF and safety testing (EO 14110)
- **Contractor Impact:** Baseline requirement for all AI work

## Value Proposition: Why ISO 42001 for Federal Work

**1. Single Framework, All Requirements**
- ISO 42001 covers OMB M-25-21, M-25-22, and EO 14110 requirements in one system
- Reduces compliance burden compared to managing multiple frameworks separately

**2. External Validation**
- Third-party ISO certification provides proof of compliance
- Stronger than self-attestation for federal procurement

**3. Competitive Advantage**
- Early adopter status (standard published Dec 2023)
- Differentiation in federal RFP responses
- Demonstrates commitment to AI excellence

**4. Contract Flow-Down Ready**
- When primes require AI compliance from subs, ISO cert satisfies requirement
- Pre-built governance structure adapts quickly to new mandates

**5. Risk Mitigation**
- ISO + NIST hybrid approach = comprehensive risk coverage
- Protects against contractor liability under EO 14110

**6. Scalability**
- Start with ISO 42001 for current AI, expand as agency requirements evolve
- Framework supports continuous improvement mandated by OMB
